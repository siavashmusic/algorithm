## Binary Search

Look for a item in a sorted list, if the item exists binary search returns the positon where it's located. Otherwise returns Null(None)

- Always look up for the mid-position of the list
- if the item is == mid return position
- if the item is smaller then mid-item 
- then high postion is  high = mid - 1
- Otherwise low position is  low = mid + 1
